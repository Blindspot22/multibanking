    ## Changelog
    ### [4.0.0-draft-4] - 2019-06-27

    #### Changed

    - The endpoint to respond to an authentication challenge has been changed to `.../{challenge-id}/response`
      (in singular) in order to reflect the fact that only a single response can be added to any
      given challenge.
    - The endpoint to initiate a payment has been renamed to `.../payments/{payment-id}/init`
    - The polling of an iniated payment process is now handled on the `.../payments/{payment-id}/init/{init-id}`
      endpoint so that it is more consistent with the respective sync endpoint and also only returns
      the necessary data for polling the status and not the full payment.
    - Added query parameter `q` on `/catalog` route to search by bank code, BIC or name
    - Added `created_at` field to a synchronization
    - Added `sepa_purpose_code` and `end_to_end_reference` to all `/payments` routes
    - Changed path parameter `countryCode`on `/catalog` route to query parameter
    - Changed attribute name `scope` to `scopes` in Consent object to reflect it's an array
    - Changed type of `challenge-id` from `integer` to `string` in "get synchronization challenge" in the "Strong Customer Authentication" authentication
    - Changed enum values on `input_format` on challenge to `STRING` and `INTEGER`
    - Changed attribute name `redirect-uri` to `location` on `RedirectChallenge`
    - Changed `icon` attribute on `/catalog` route to include URLs to alternative resolutions
    - Changed status code from `200` to `201` on a successful user creation.

    #### Deleted
    - Removed `recovery_password` from response on `POST /auth/user`
    - Removed `text_key` on all `/payments` routes
    - Removed `recovery-password` from `/auth/user` response


    ### [4.0.0-draft-3] - 2019-06-19

    #### Changed

    - The handling of background operations (e.g. synchronization) has been simplified. The state of
      the operation can either be `QUEUED`, `RUNNING`, `AWAIT_AUTH`, `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`. The
      former states `started` and `authorized` have been removed. For a detailed description of the
      state-machine that a background operation can traverse see the "Background operations"
      paragraph in the [Synchronizations](#tag/Synchronizations) chapter.
    - When polling the state of a background operation the current authorization challenge is now
      directly embedded into the response. Furthermore it is not necessary anymore to poll a second
      endpoint (e.g. `.../syncs/{sync-id}/authorizations/{auth-id}`) in order to solve a challenge.
      Instead the challenge presented in the poll-response (whenever a background operation is in
      the `AWAIT_AUTH` state) can be directly forwarded to the end-user.
    - The authorization challenge response is now provided as a `POST` operation to the
      `.../challenges/{challenge-id}/responses` endpoint. See [here](#operation/solveSyncChallenge)
      for further information.
    - The `.../authorizations` endpoint has been renamed to `.../challenges` and the fields of the
      embedded `challenge` object are now at top-level. See the response of the [challenge
      request](#operation/getSyncChallenge) for further information. The schema of the challenge
      response is equivalent to the embedded challenge in the synchronization poll-response.
    - The naming of enumeration values has been unified to consistently use uppercase letters.
    - The field `additional_information` of the embedded challenge has been renamed to
      `additional_info`.
    - The field `tan_schemes` of the SCA method [selection challenge](#operation/getSyncChallenge)
      has been renamed to `auth_methods`.
    - The field `supported_tan_schems` of the [provider access](#operation/getProviderAccess)
      response has been renamed to `auth_methods`.
    - The field `consent_configuration` of the request body to create a provider access has been
      renamed to `consent` to be consistent with the respective field of the response.
    - The id of the provider access resource is not a UUID anymore but does conform to the standard
      format of all other resources (e.g. X12345.6).
    - The field `in_PSD2_Scope` of the access-method object in the catalog has been renamed to
      `in_psd2_scope`.
    - The fields `product_version` and `product_environment` of the `/version`-call have been renamed
      to `version` and `environment`.
    - The fields `current_language` and `available_languages` in the `language` sub-object of the
      catalog items have been renamed to `current` and `avaialable`.

    ### New

    - All authorization challenges are identified by an integer `id` and have a `created_at` field.

    ### Removed

    - The `product_name` field of the `/version` call has been removed.

    ### [4.0.0-draft-2] - 2019-06-13
    #### Changed

    - Transaction fields `booking_date` and `value_date` renamed to `booked_at` and `settled_at` to
      stay consistent with naming scheme.
    - UserDetails field `joined_date` renamed to `joined_at` for above reasons.

    ### Removed

    - Status `started` was removed from AuthorizationStatus

    ### [4.0.0-draft-1] - 2019-05-29
    ### <div style="color: red">Important</div>

    This is a draft version of the new figo API. It is therefore in general subject to change.
    However, we do not expect major changes in the endpoint structure itself but most likely in the
    details (e.g. addition renaming of a field or flag)

    #### New

    - The [`/rest/accesses`](#tag/Accesses) endpoint is introduced and replaces the `POST
      /rest/accounts` call to create new accesses to the figo API. Use this endpoint to connect your
      user's accounts with the figo API.
    - `/rest/accesses` also supersedes the `/rest/banks` route and now includes calls for connected
      provider accesses
    - Every resource requiring authorization with a Financial Provider (Banks, ASPSPs etc) now has a
      subresource of `../authorizations`
    - Introduced new types for SCA Challenges. The current challenges have been merged into the
      `EmbeddedChallenge` type.

    #### Extended

    - The [`/rest/catalog`](http://psd2-docs-preview.figo.io/index.html#tag/Catalog) base path has
      been extended with our new catalog data model fit for PSD2

    #### Changed

    - `/rest/sync` is replaced by `/rest/accesses/{access-id}/syncs`. So a synchronization of
      accounts is now semantically placed as a subresource of an access since a synchronization is
      only valid in the context of a given access for a given user and account.
    - Creating a new Access via `POST /rest/accesses` no longer automatically triggers an Account
      Synchronization. To schedule a Synchronization after a successfull Access creation, issue a
      `POST /rest/accesses/{access-id}/syncs` call. This clearer separation of semantics aims to
      provide greater control to the API consumer.
    - TANSchemes have been moved from `/rest/accounts` to `/rest/accesses/`
    - timestamp attributes have been renamed to `<created|deleted|updated|expires>-at`
    - The `AccessToken`length is now arbitrary.

    #### Removed

    - `POST /rest/accounts` was removed in favor of `POST /rest/accesses` to create a new access for
      an user
    - `/task/progress` was removed in favor of a more functional model for processing work items.
      Instead of having a multi-functional `task/progress` endpoint, we now support specific
      endpoints for each step of the use-case. For instance, creating a synchronization (`POST
      /rest/accesses/{access-id}/syncs`) responds with a Synchronization object which itself exposes
      its current state (see JobStatus) and can be polled for progress tracking. This pattern is
      equally true for Payments, Authorizations and Standing Orders.
    - `/rest/banks` was removed in favor of `/rest/accesses`.


    ## Introduction

    This is the technical documentation of the figo API. For a general introduction to figo services
    please visit [https://www.figo.io](https://www.figo.io).

    The figo API offers a unified interface to thousands of banks and numerous payment service
    providers.  It provides services like retrieving the transaction history, initiating payments,
    viewing security portfolios, or receiving notifications on changes like incoming transactions.

    ### Request API access

    To request client credentials to use the figo API visit
    [https://www.figo.io/client-id](https://www.figo.io/client-id).

    ### Demo Bank

    To get acquainted with the API without using a real bank access, figo provides a demo bank. It
    offers all necessary data for testing and integration in your application.

    ## Technical foundation

    All API access is over HTTPS and all data is sent and received as JSON unless otherwise
    specified.

    ### Errors

    If an error occurs during a request, the API returns an HTTP status code >=400 and provides more
    information in the response-body.

    #### Error Object Structure

    | Field         | Description                                                             |
    | --            | --                                                                      |
    | `code`        | Numeric representation of the error                                     |
    | `data`        | Additional error information (validation information and other details) |
    | `description` | Short summary                                                           |
    | `group`       | Group of error                                                          |
    | `message`     | Original message of the bank (only in task errors)                      |

    #### Error Codes

    Error codes are grouped in ranges

    | Range         | Group          |

        "description": "Not Found",
        "group": "client",
      }
    }
    ```

    ## JWE encryption

    The figo API provides the ability to encrypt sensitive information like credentials and
    authentication challenge responses with [JSON Web Encryption](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516).
    This is an additional security mechanism to the usual transport layer encryption of the
    data.

    A common use-case is when a client application communicates through an intermediate server with
    the figo API.  To avoid privacy and security issues the sensitive data can be encrypted with
    [JWE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516) on the client application side to conceal them from
    the intermediate server.

    figo provides an [example library](https://github.com/figo-connect/figo_jwe_example) which
    implements client-side JWE encryption of the credential fields.

      Each financial provider account has a list of transactions associated with it. In general the
      information provided for each transaction should be roughly similar to the contents of the
      printed or online transaction statement available from the respective provider. Please note
      that not all banks provide the same level of detail.

      Fields marked with *HBCI* contain additional data retrieved from banks supporting HBCI and are

      same level of detail.

  - name: Standing Orders
    description: |
      Bank accounts can have standing orders associated with them if supported by the respective bank.

      ## Execution day and interval

      When working with standing orders you have to take some characteristics into account. If a
      `last_execution_date` is set, the standing order has a limited term and will not run
      indefinitely.  Its day of month must be the same as that of the first execution.

      If you want to identify the next execution date you have to use the `interval` and `execution_day`
      parameters to calculate the next execution date. interval defines the regular cycle the
      standing order gets executed.  On top of it the `execution_day` states the day of execution
      within the interval.

      This value depends on the `interval` chosen. If the interval is set to `weekly`, possible values
      for `execution_day` are: `0` (daily), `1` (Monday), `2` (Tuesday) â€¦ `7` (Sunday). Note that
      not every bank supports the `weekly` interval.

      If the interval is set to one of the other possible values, `execution_day` could be: `1-30`
      (1st day of the month to 30th day of the month) or `97` (closing of the month minus two), `98`
      (closing of the month minus one), `99` (closing of the month).

      The same values are used for all the other intervals. That is, you can only specify the day of
      month of a payment, even for yearly payments. The date of a repeated execution is then
      computed by adding interval to the month of the date of submission, ignoring
      `first_execution_date`, and using `execution_day` for day of month.

      #### (Contrived) Example:

      - Submission: 2017-01-20
      - First execution: 2017-02-10
      - Interval: half yearly
      - Execution day: 15
      - Next execution (computed): 2017-06-15

      To be sure, set the execution day to the day of the first execution and set the first
      execution date in the current month.

      #### (Realistic) Example:

      - Submission: 2017-02-01
      - First execution: 2017-02-10
      - Interval: half yearly
      - Execution day: 20
      - Next execution (computed): 2017-07-20

      The minimum lead time (time between submission and first execution) is 2 days, maximum lead
      time is 180 days.  This means you cannot submit a standing order to be executed on the same
      day.

      Also note that the actual execution of a standing order may occur later due to weekends or
      holidays.

  - name: Notifications
    description: |
      Whenever an account gets synchronized with the associated financial provider and new data is
      fetched, your application can asynchronously be notified via webhooks about certain events.
      For which events your application gets called depends on the notification key used, whose
      format is described in the following section.

      For a notification to be considered as delivered successfully, the webhook endpoint should
      return HTTP response codes in the range of `2xx` or `3xx`. Everything else will be
      assumed an error.

      ## Callback Request Headers

      When a notification is triggerd the configured callback endpoint is called by the figo API
      setting the `User-Agent` header to `figo-notification/<figo-api-version>`. E.g.

      ```
      User-Agent: figo-notification/3.6.0
      ```

      # Observe Keys

      When configuring a new notification you have to specify an observe key which defines the
      trigger condition for the notification. The observe key is composed of a path and a number of
      query parameters similar to an URL without scheme and host part.

      A client is only allowed to configure a notification of a certain type if he has the required
      scope for this specific notification.

    description: |
      ## One figo user per application user

      If the use case requires to interact with the figo API for one user over an extended period of
      time, it is recommended to create one figo user per application user. This way the data of
      each of your users is securely separated.

      In this scenario it is recommended to create the figo users with a username directly mappable
      from your application user IDs, e.g. using  `<your user ID>@figo.<yourapplication domain>`.
      That way you do not have to save any additional information and still do not block email
      address of your user for explicit figo API usage. A similar, but more secure, mapping is
      recommended for the user's password.

      ## One figo user per application transaction

      It is possible to only integrate the figo API as part of processing a transaction, e.g. to
      verify account owner information. In this scenario it is recommended to create one figo user
      per transaction and delete it after the figo API integration part of the transaction
      processing is completed.

      For the same reasons as in the other case a simple mapping between your transaction and the
      figo username/password is recommended for this case as well, e.g. `<your transaction
      ID>@figo.<your application domain>` as username.

      In order to keep transaction processing time as short as possible, we recommend to defer any
      clean-up activities.

  - name: Synchronizations
    description: |

      ## Connect a provider access

      In order to be able to fetch financial data from a provider the corresponding access has
      to be configured first. The configuration procedure is summarized as follows

      1. Lookup the financial provider to be connected in [the catalog](#operation/listCatalog) and
         select one of the available access methods. Also notice which credentials are required to
         be used for this provider access.
      2. Obtain the required login credentials as specified by the access method from the customer.
      3. Add a new [access](#operation/addProviderAccess) handle.
      4. Start a [synchronization](#operation/createSync) for the access.
      5. Guide the customer through the process of strong customer authentication.

      ## Synchronize a provider access

      In order to keep the financial data accessible through the figo API up-to-date the financial
      provider has to be periodically queried for updates. This process is called synchronization.
      The figo API performs an automatic synchronization on a daily basis, as long as the customer
      has given the authorization to store the credentials for the provider access to be
      synchronized.

      A synchronization that is manually triggerd through the API allows the customer to respond to
      authorization challenges.

      ## Background operations

      Interactions with a financial service provider are never executed in the scope of an API
      request but rather performed asynchroneously in the background. A synchronization is an
      example for such a background operation. The states that a synchronization can traverse during
      its lifetime are defined by the following state-machine.

      <div class="diagram">
        graph LR
        B[QUEUED]
        B --> C[RUNNING]
        C --> D[AWAIT_AUTH]
        D --> |response created| C
        C --> E[FAILED]
        D --> E
        C --> F[COMPLETED]
      </div>

      Every synchronization starts in the `QUEDED` state and is moved to the `RUNNING` state when it
      is picked up by the job processing backend. While communicating with the financial service
      provider an authorization challenge can be issued, in which case the syncrhonization is moved
      to the `AWAIT_AUTH` state. In this state the end-user's interaction is required in order to
      [solve the challenge](#operation/solveSyncChallenge). For a detailed description of
      available challange types see the section [Strong Customer Authentication](#tag/Strong-Customer-Authentication).

      After the challenge has been solved the synchronization switches back to the `RUNNING` state
      and eventually to the `COMPLETED` state. While processing a syncrhonization multiple
      authorization challenges can be issued so that the state can toggle between `AWAIT_AUTH` and
      `RUNNING`. In case of an error the work item's state will be set to `FAILED` and no further
      processing will take place.


  - name: Strong Customer Authentication
    description: |
      The PSD2 requires a strong customer authentication for all interactions with a customer's
      bank. This means that two out of the following three factors have to be used for
      authentication:

      - Possession
      - Inherence (Identity)
      - Knowledge

      An authenticated customer can authorize interactions triggered through the figo API, like
      e.g. a synchronization of account and transaction data or the submission of a payment.

      The following sections describe the challenge types supported by the figo API.

      ### Decoupled challenges

      In this case the process of strong customer authentication is to be carried out with a
      device or app that is provided by the financial service provider.

      ### Redirect challenges

      In case of a redirect challenge the authentication is performed at the authentication
      server of the financial service provider. The customer's user agent has to be redirected to
      the URI given in the challenge.

      ### Embedded challenges

      In this case the authentication process is embedded into the user interface on the side of
      the TPP. The following different formats of challenges are available

      | Format | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
      | ---    | ---                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
      | TEXT   | An instructional text from the service provider describing further steps.                                                                                                                               |
      | HTML   | Similar to TEXT but with additional markup.                                                                                                                                                             |
      | HHD    | The data encodes an animated image processable by the users TAN generator. Please [contact us](mailto:developer@figo.io) in case you would like to provide native support for this in your application. |
      | PHOTO  | An image which should be shown to the user. The image is encoded following [RFC 2397](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397)                                                                               |

      **Note**: An end user might have multiple SCA methods available to him. In this case a SCA
      method has to be selected.

        To modify an existing standing order, conduct the following steps:

        1. [Synchronize accounts](#operation/createSync), including `standingOrders` in
           `sync_tasks`.
        1. `GET /rest/standing_orders` and pick `standing_order_id` of the one to modify.
        1. `PUT /rest/accounts/{account-id}/payments` with `standing_order_id` and fields to modify.
            Response contains a `payment-id`.
        1. `POST /rest/accounts/{account-id}/payments/{payment-id}/init` to submit modified
           standing order to bank.
        1. Authorize the payment submission by solving the authentication challenge presented when
           polling the payment.

        In order to access any information belonging to a user, a client has to
        authenticate with a token linking itself to the user. This token is called an
        `access token` and contains information on the client, the user and the level of access
        the client has to the users data. In order to authenticate using such an access token the
        HTTP header `Authorization` is set to `Bearer <access token>`. The  `access token` is formatted
        as a JSON Web Token according to [RFC7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)

        Such an `access token` is either returned when

        * exchanging an authorization code after a successful OAuth login flow
        * logging in with the user's credentials
        * exchanging a refresh token, which is returned at either of the aforementioned points

        ## Authentication errors

        In case of an authentication error a HTTP code 401 response is returned containing further
        details on the kind of error in the `WWW-Authenticate` header.

        In addition to the below listed scope the flags are used for simple boolean permissions.

        | Flag            | Description                                  |
        | --              | --                                           |
        | submit_payments | Allow submission of payments to bank server  |
        | offline         | Access figo API when the user is not present |
        | create_user     | Allow creation of figo accounts              |
